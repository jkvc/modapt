0,"The book was delivered quickly and in good shape but I was disappointed in the content. No offense, I think it's just more relevant to those younger than I. My spiritual journey is 60 years old and this just didn't hit home with me.  I hope others are blessed by reading it.",0,amazon
1,"have always loved the play Henry V by Shakespeare (and the Kenneth Branagh adaptation) but never understood how it was possible so few English soldiers killed so many French. This historical novel makes it crystal clear. It follows the life of an English archer, and explains well the mechanics or archery and fighting with medieval weapons. It describes the dirt and grime of the Middle Ages and the gore of battle without being stomach-turning disgusting. And it has remarkable clean language and implied sexual content so it is suitable for older teens studying the Middle Ages. The description of the Battle of Agincourt is extensive and detailed. &#34;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, This day shall gentle his condition.&#34;",1,amazon
2,Lawrence Block can always always be counted on to deliver a great read! I highly recommend anything he has written.,1,amazon
3,Soap opera in a setting of generic swords 'n demons fantasy.  I prefer Mr. Martin's earlier work such as &#34;Sandkings&#34;.,0,amazon

5,"I don't read enough books by male authors, though when I do, it's always an interesting thing to read about how they write female characters, especially young female characters. I thought Wiley Cash was accurate in his portrayal of two young girls: one only at the tender age of 7, and a pre-teen of 12. Overall, however, This Dark Road to Mercy failed to capture my full attention-the story line started out flat, and continued that way without much deviation or excitement.Told from three alternating POVS, This Dark Road to Mercy was a wild goose chase, with flashbacks and resentment thrown in for good measure. An estranged father kidnaps his two daughters (one being Easter, POV #1) from their group home, loaded with cash and a reason to run. The person hot on their trail, Pruitt (POV #2), has a vendetta and his own troubled back story to tell. All the while, Brady Weller (POV #3), is taking his role as ad litem of the kidnapped girls to a whole new level, as he helps uncover the link between the disappearance of the girls, and another open crime case.I felt like this book had the best intentions, and some intensely good raw material to work with, so it was unfortunate that it ended up reading like an episode of a mediocre prime time detective show. When the POV alternated, I only knew it did because the name above the chapter told me so, otherwise, all three narrators blended into one collective, dull, voice-I wouldn't have been able to tell them apart if there wasn't dialogue in each section. The saving grace of This Dark Road to Mercy was Wade Chesterfield, the estranged father. His character was the only one to invoke enough emotion in me to continue pressing on. His desperation, and the fact that his motives were the reason for pretty much the story line of the entire book, made him the stand out character in my eyes.Main qualm: Cash's use of baseball terms, facts, and players were completely lost on me-baseball is one of my least favourite sports, and I, unfortunately, tended to glaze over those moments in the book.This Dark Road to Mercy just wasn't for me, though I could definitely see it being the exact read that someone else would enjoy, especially a reader with an affinity for sports and detective novels. There seems to be much more to be found in Wiley's other work, so I will definitely be checking that out!",0,amazon
6,"Found another good author of historical mystery novels.  Kate Ross does a great job of describing the Victorian Era and a better job of spinning a good mystery,",1,amazon
7,"""Red Herring"" is a pretty good installment in the Joe Gunther series.  The plot regarding a serial killer who seems impossible to catch works pretty well.  The main characters' actions  are consistent with their behavior in previous books.  The Vermont setting is typically well drawn by Mayor.  Overall, the usual elements that make an Archer Mayor mystery good are present, and I can recommend this book.Several plot elements in ""Red Herring"" were of particular interest to me.  First, Mayor allows the new woman in Joe Gunther's life and his former girlfriend of many years to meet.  Readers of this series have to have been wondering how Gail is going to deal with Joe's new love.  Second, there are also some interesting forensics to help solve the mystery this time.  Third, the ending, including the final scene with Willy,  is very unexpected and very dramatic, which is quite a good move on Mayor's part.I have a couple of criticisms.  I feel the amount of detail related to the forensic aspects of the case is too much at times.  Also, I struggle again with Mayor's point-of-view shifts.  This time he tells the story through his main characters along with brief sections in which the victims are featured.  Then at the end he suddenly starts to include sections from the killer's point of view.  This change just feels so inconsistent, and I notice it immediately. I actually find it pretty annoying when Mayor does this.For more mystery series that may entertain you, check out my website describing and reviewing many series (see my Amazon profile for the URL).",1,amazon
8,"A small part of the Michael Lewis's best-selling book, ""The Blind Side"" and the popular movie of the same title, starring Sandra Bullock. Finally, Michael Oher has co-authored his own book about HIS remarkable story. Oher's book is definitely not some short piece of fluff. It covers 21 chapters over about 250 pages, and sheds light on the real life Michael Oher lived. While this book is easy to read, it still packs a powerful punch. The most touching chapter...""The Day They Took Me Away,"" describes what happened when Child Protective Services came to take him from his mother. One theme that comes through loud and clear is that Michael Oher was very determined to make something of himself.In short, this book gives huge addition to the other books and gives more depth than the movie about Michael Oher's life. It has a lot of interesting material, and it packs an important, inspiring and profound message. Completely worth the time and the money. More importantly, sheds light on the 500,000 children that are in the foster care system and what their lives and limits the system can handle.",1,amazon
