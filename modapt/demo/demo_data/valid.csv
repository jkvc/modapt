1,"have always loved the play Henry V by Shakespeare (and the Kenneth Branagh adaptation) but never understood how it was possible so few English soldiers killed so many French. This historical novel makes it crystal clear. It follows the life of an English archer, and explains well the mechanics or archery and fighting with medieval weapons. It describes the dirt and grime of the Middle Ages and the gore of battle without being stomach-turning disgusting. And it has remarkable clean language and implied sexual content so it is suitable for older teens studying the Middle Ages. The description of the Battle of Agincourt is extensive and detailed. &#34;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, This day shall gentle his condition.&#34;",1,amazon

5,"I don't read enough books by male authors, though when I do, it's always an interesting thing to read about how they write female characters, especially young female characters. I thought Wiley Cash was accurate in his portrayal of two young girls: one only at the tender age of 7, and a pre-teen of 12. Overall, however, This Dark Road to Mercy failed to capture my full attention-the story line started out flat, and continued that way without much deviation or excitement.Told from three alternating POVS, This Dark Road to Mercy was a wild goose chase, with flashbacks and resentment thrown in for good measure. An estranged father kidnaps his two daughters (one being Easter, POV #1) from their group home, loaded with cash and a reason to run. The person hot on their trail, Pruitt (POV #2), has a vendetta and his own troubled back story to tell. All the while, Brady Weller (POV #3), is taking his role as ad litem of the kidnapped girls to a whole new level, as he helps uncover the link between the disappearance of the girls, and another open crime case.I felt like this book had the best intentions, and some intensely good raw material to work with, so it was unfortunate that it ended up reading like an episode of a mediocre prime time detective show. When the POV alternated, I only knew it did because the name above the chapter told me so, otherwise, all three narrators blended into one collective, dull, voice-I wouldn't have been able to tell them apart if there wasn't dialogue in each section. The saving grace of This Dark Road to Mercy was Wade Chesterfield, the estranged father. His character was the only one to invoke enough emotion in me to continue pressing on. His desperation, and the fact that his motives were the reason for pretty much the story line of the entire book, made him the stand out character in my eyes.Main qualm: Cash's use of baseball terms, facts, and players were completely lost on me-baseball is one of my least favourite sports, and I, unfortunately, tended to glaze over those moments in the book.This Dark Road to Mercy just wasn't for me, though I could definitely see it being the exact read that someone else would enjoy, especially a reader with an affinity for sports and detective novels. There seems to be much more to be found in Wiley's other work, so I will definitely be checking that out!",0,amazon

7,"""Red Herring"" is a pretty good installment in the Joe Gunther series.  The plot regarding a serial killer who seems impossible to catch works pretty well.  The main characters' actions  are consistent with their behavior in previous books.  The Vermont setting is typically well drawn by Mayor.  Overall, the usual elements that make an Archer Mayor mystery good are present, and I can recommend this book.Several plot elements in ""Red Herring"" were of particular interest to me.  First, Mayor allows the new woman in Joe Gunther's life and his former girlfriend of many years to meet.  Readers of this series have to have been wondering how Gail is going to deal with Joe's new love.  Second, there are also some interesting forensics to help solve the mystery this time.  Third, the ending, including the final scene with Willy,  is very unexpected and very dramatic, which is quite a good move on Mayor's part.I have a couple of criticisms.  I feel the amount of detail related to the forensic aspects of the case is too much at times.  Also, I struggle again with Mayor's point-of-view shifts.  This time he tells the story through his main characters along with brief sections in which the victims are featured.  Then at the end he suddenly starts to include sections from the killer's point of view.  This change just feels so inconsistent, and I notice it immediately. I actually find it pretty annoying when Mayor does this.For more mystery series that may entertain you, check out my website describing and reviewing many series (see my Amazon profile for the URL).",1,amazon
8,"A small part of the Michael Lewis's best-selling book, ""The Blind Side"" and the popular movie of the same title, starring Sandra Bullock. Finally, Michael Oher has co-authored his own book about HIS remarkable story. Oher's book is definitely not some short piece of fluff. It covers 21 chapters over about 250 pages, and sheds light on the real life Michael Oher lived. While this book is easy to read, it still packs a powerful punch. The most touching chapter...""The Day They Took Me Away,"" describes what happened when Child Protective Services came to take him from his mother. One theme that comes through loud and clear is that Michael Oher was very determined to make something of himself.In short, this book gives huge addition to the other books and gives more depth than the movie about Michael Oher's life. It has a lot of interesting material, and it packs an important, inspiring and profound message. Completely worth the time and the money. More importantly, sheds light on the 500,000 children that are in the foster care system and what their lives and limits the system can handle.",1,amazon

12,"PROS: Vast scope of ideas, steeply based in science, epic qualityCONS: Writing style is a bit dryBOTTOM LINE: Great collection of related stories.BRIEF SYNOPSIS: A collection of related stories set in Baxter's Xeelee Universe.The memorable things about Baxter's stories are not so much his characters, nor his writing style, which is a somewhat stiff, but rather his ideas.  Each story contained in this collection contains some form of scientific concept that defies any simple comprehension due to sheer scale, large and small.  Sometimes travel spans universes, sometimes beings are microscopic in size, and sometimes artifacts are light years wide.  Baxter's signature hard science is present here in a big way.The stories average 14 pages in length but are packed with all these ideas.  Many of the stories, spanning 5 million years, reference the same events or reference each other, which is always a secret thrill for a science fiction reader.One huge plus in Vacuum Diagram's is the Xeelee Sequence Timelins listed at the back of the book.  This makes it prerequisite reading for anyone wishing to dive into Baxter's 4 Xeelee novels (in Xeelee Universe order: Timelike Infinity, Raft, Flux and Ring).",1,amazon

14,"In a market flooded with blatant Twilight rip-offs and slightly toned down adult paranormal romance, Beautiful Creatures is surprisingly refreshing. To begin with, Beautiful Creatures features a male protagonist without paranormal abilities and a female lead with abilities. While there is a love story, it is woven into a larger, more engaging plot filled with edge-of-your-seat mystery and intrigue.When I first read the synopsis of the novel, I was expecting yet another teen vampire romance that follows every clich&eacute; in the genre right now. But the marketing information (as well as the novel's title) ended up being misleading -in a good way.Beautiful Creatures centers around teenager Ethan, who lives in the boring (and somewhat backward) Southern town of Gatlin. Ethan begins to have strange visions of the past and finds that the town's newest resident, Lena, shares his visions. As the two become friends and eventually fall in love, Ethan finds that there is more to Lena and her crazy, shut-in Uncle Macon Ravenwood than meets the eye.  Lena comes from a long line of magic-users, called Casters, and on her sixteenth birthday, her fate will be decided forever.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel. Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl weave a compelling mystery that kept me flipping pages. I was even more surprised that this novel looks like it won't have any sequels -it's so powerful and entertaining that readers will probably be clamoring for more (well, I am, anyway). While the pacing occasionally gets a little off (the book is over 600 pages), the need to find out the truth behind the mystery and discover the characters' fate will keep readers going.This is a great book for any one (of any age) who enjoys paranormal/mystery stories geared toward teens with a romance element.",1,amazon

17,"Here's the short version:This hilariously terrifying delve into the mind of a modern Westernised human being read like it was written by a 15yr old anime-porn addicted Stephen King.Here's the long version:To begin with, I didn't know this was the beginning of a series of books. Had I known, then the ending probably wouldn't have been so disappointing for me. The first half of the book was rife with stark potty humour and vividly grotesque visuals, the kind a Robot Chicken or video game fan would find appealing. This is not a negative judgement; I thoroughly enjoy the aforementioned literary cheese. Its a fast flowing yet compelling story filled with easily-imaginable unimaginable horrors, thanks to the writing style of the twisted person who wrote this. Seriously, its some pretty gross stuff.After you are thrust into the main characters disgusting world against your will, you start to find the most obscene scenes funny and delightful, the dialogue expressed in terse blasts that allow the reader to become happily lost in the confusing plot twists and bizarre time jumps. As for the plot itself, I'm not a fan of explaining the contents of a book in its review. That's what the back of the book is for. I will say, however, that my Stephen King reference was not a cheap jab; this story is very much like a cartoon horror story about friends, saving the world, and being a real person.I did find the conclusion to be a let down, only because it was dragged out over more pages than were necessary, completely devoid of any of the sick comedy that carried me through the entire adventure. Having learned its a continuing story, it makes sense. But I cant help feeling like the writer got struck with Lost syndrome; unable to find a cohesive way to justify the ridiculousness he's almost finished, it seems like he opted for the quick finish.All in all, if you can stomach the kind of dark horrors you only dream about on the worst of nights -yet laugh about with your peers the next day- then you will probably enjoy John Dies At The End.",1,amazon
18,"An epic historical novel, similar with its scholar-detective protagonists to The Da Vinci Code, reading like a sequel to Stoker's Dracula. A thrilling, meaty read.

20,"It is fair to say that this bold brilliant book is difficult to read in one sitting, but compelling enough to stop you from taking anything but the smallest break. I agree with most of the reviews, except for those who compare Dewitt to Bukowski simply because they have written about the same subject. Novels about alcoholics are not a ""genre"" any more than ""Eat, Pray, Love"" is chick lit.  Dewitt is a profoundly powerful witness of self inflicted pain. His heroic tale of a desperate alcoholic surrounded by the already fallen is riveting. As his world shrinks, and his future goes no further than his next debauch, the bartender pours free drinks, hands out money for drugs, even tries to poison one customer with his own blood, as if by making them worse he will become better. Gasp, laugh, but do not weep....Dewitt has written a novel beyond weeping. A true literary feat.",1,amazon

22,"I watched the movie of this book before I read the book itself, and I have to say that the movie has taken some liberties with the story and the book is still better than the movie despite its great storm special effects.  Nobody can say exactly what happened to the swordboat Andrea Gail but this book does a credible job of describing what probably happened based on knowledge of swordfish fishermen, the fishing industry, the ocean, storm behaviour and the rescue services involved.Having read this book I now feel I know a lot more about swordfish and the fishing industry than I ever believed I would. I also feel I've been given a reasonable education in storm and wave behaviour around the Grand Banks and northern fishing waters.  You have to have some patience with this book as the Storm of the title doesn't really start to play a part in its story till half way through the book. Up till then everything is mostly background material about the fishing industry.  However, even if you know nothing about the sea, this book covers so many topics in so much depth that it keeps you moving along till the tragedies and triumphs of the storm and its human costs are played out. A recommended read if you like your stories factually based but not debased to the point of being ""based on a true story"".",1,amazon
23,"After the hype surrounding this book I was a bit disappointed with the first chapter. It's here that we're introduced to the titular Philadelphia matriarch Hattie, seen here as a young woman in 1925 struggling (and, ultimately failing) to keep her first two children alive. It's not just that it's depressing, but it also feels a bit stilted and difficult to connect with. Luckily, the very next chapter, we fast-forward to 1948 and another character with a more engaging story. From this point on, each chapter becomes more and more rewarding, adding richness and depth to the various lives that surround Hattie. And by the end, that first chapter is shown to be as important as anything else in the book.As the title suggests, Hattie has 12 children. Ayana Mathis' book covers Hattie's life from 1925 to 1980, through the eyes of several of these children, as well as some relatives, friends and even a grandchild. Some have pointed out that the structure of the book is a bit like a collection of connected short stories and I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that, however, I would say that there is quite a bit more connectivity here than a typical short story collection. Also, the forward motion through time helps make it clear what the connections are between characters and how things that happened in previous chapters affected other characters that we might not have originally considered.Overall, this is a really impressive and engrossing study in family, relationships, poverty and mental illness (yes, quite a bit of mental illness). There's a slow build from beginning to end regarding Hattie's character, so that the final few pages deliver quite a stirring emotional punch.",1,amazon
24,"When I saw this book on the bookstore shelf, I knew it had to be good.  I mean, come on, who can rhyme better and with more wit than Weird Al?  And it does not disappoint.  As some of the other posters have said, it does have some advanced language but the pictures and sing-songy text will appeal to even the younger readers who can't understand all the words.  Not only is it a lot of fun, but the end is touching.  The only tip I would give is with regards to the length.  This book has a lot of text and probably wouldn't appeal to a kid who has a short attention span for reading.  Well done, Al.  I hope this is the first of many children's book for you!",1,amazon
25,"First, I loved Her vampire books, read them all! and I was really hoping she would write more at least in the Blackstone family books, but It never occurred to me she would next write about werewolves. I have about one chapter left in this book and I love it!. It is as good as her other books if not better and I was expecting a lot from The Wolf Gift and I was not let down. It's hard for me to stop reading it at night because its like I'm right there. Her descriptions of the world and people are so real it feels like you know them, like your almost there. I can really feel what Ruben feels and feel like I almost know him from her rich writing.I won't say much more because other people have left reviews worded much better than I can write. Just know if you like her other books you will not be disappointed in this one either. I can't wait for the next book in this series in October now! I really hope there are even more than one more!I really can't afford to spend full price on many books so I save my money for only my very favorites and the very best writers and Ann Rice is right there on top of that List. Thank you Ann for writing again about the magical world of mythical creatures and I am not giving up hope we will see at least one more book on vampires from you too!",1,amazon
26,"After reading 200+ pages of this book, I STOPPED!!  Wondering why I spent so much time on so little plot.  The book is ponderous and lacking plot.  The characters enter the novel, something happens of little interest, then they leave ... and it takes too long for them to return. When they do return you are not even certain who they are.  Bakker complicates an already difficult book with names that are unprouncable (even in your head!)  There is too little dialogue, too much 'telling' not enough 'showing'.  This is definitely an introduction set up for other books, but I, for one will not get to them as the author failed to hold my interest in the first one.DAH",0,amazon
27,"I picked up Mad Ship on the strength of my positive experience with her Farseer trilogy. I am glad I did, because it looks as though it will be another series that will keep me entertained and engaged-- even when it means reading a book *way* past my bedtime.Ship of Magic draws from a wealth of other maritime writing to provide enough realistic details to make the conceit (a town that depends on a kind of living ship for their livelihood) work very well. I was willing to buy the details of life on board the ships and I was not able to easily poke holes in the fantasy world that the book creates.Her characters are both strongly drawn and appropriately flawed. One of the best things about her work in general has been the fine and realistic characters with whom she populates her fantasy world. I liked the way that Althea and Wintrow (the two main characters in this book) are introduced and contrasted and I see enough in both of them to keep the reader hooked throughout the rest of the trilogy.A great beginning, and an overall great read for fans of literate and readable fantasy novels.",1,amazon
28,"I am a fan of Spong's because he is not afraid to give voice to the inaccuracies and illogical parts of the Bible that religious conservatives see as being the literal, inerrant ""words of (their) God"".  Unlike other progressive biblical scholars who tend to be a tad bit more gracious in how they phrase things, Spong doesn't mince words and is quite willing to poke and prod - sometimes cattle-prod? - the views of the Bible by Christian fundamentalists.  This book is very good at deconstructing and pulling apart biblical scripture and showing the difficulties in reading all parts / most parts as literal, historical fact.  It's great at de-bunking literalism... unfortunately though THIS book of Spong's doesn't do enough to explain how one CAN read the Bible in a progressive way which aids one's faith.  THIS book leaves you feeling that the Bible doesn't have a lot to say of worth for God-loving, Jesus-loving, progressive Christians.  Athiests and folks who want to leave conservative theology behind will find good reasons here.  I do know that Spong has talked about his views of a new, progressive Christian theology and faith in other, more recent books of his, which I've read, and REALLY encourge others to read as well.  I just felt the need to point out the problem I had with THIS book, and why I can't give it 5 stars.",1,amazon

37,"This book has gotten a lot of buzz, and it met all of my expectations.  One of the best things about the whole story is Elisa's transformation from a self conscience, insecure younger sister to a warrior and a leader.  When I am reading YA, I am always looking for the protagonist that grows and overcomes adversity and this story was that and more.  Elisa was so quiet and unsure of herself in the first part of the book that I didn't think she would be able to become Queen or survive her husband's court.  As the story unfolds, she is forced to fight and then becomes willing to fight.  She is fighting for what she believes is just and is even willing to sacrifice her own life to do it.Elisa's character is not the only one that shows development.  The people who grow to love her and eventually look to her as a leader become as dear to you as Elisa herself.  I loved the feeling of really getting to know everyone in the story and even changing my opinion about a few of them.  This book was exciting, gut-wrenching adventure with a side of romance that was beautiful and bittersweet.  I am really looking forward to seeing what Rae Carson does with the next book in the series.  I gave this book 4 stars.",1,amazon
38,"I found another series that I can't believe that I waited so long to start reading. I thoroughly enjoyed the blend of fantasy and romance. Most of Ascension moved like an urban fantasy for me. The world's dynamics and the ascension process seemed to take precedence over the romance. With that said I want to point out that there is plenty of romance. Kerrick and Alison are nearly combustible for the majority of the book. The details that were put into the world building, the bureaucracies that keep the dimensions secret and in constant turmoil, and the process of ascension are just amazing. Roane has built a fabulously imaginative world and she has painted a very detailed picture of it for her readers.Alison has always known she is different. She has abilities that no other person she knows has. Her abilities have forced her to not allow people into her life. She has inadvertently harmed those she cares about. The easiest solution, isolation from those she could potentially harm.Kerrick has vowed to never let another woman get close to him ever again. He has experienced loss of loved ones due to who, what he is. He is a Warrior of the Blood. He protects Second Earth. He protects innocents from the death vamps. He is also a guardian to ascendiates. His boss has assigned him to Alison, even though everyone knows how he feels about guarding females.It is soon discovered that Alison is not the normal when it comes to ascendiates. She has some incredible power and her abilities surpass those of most Second Earth residents. This spells trouble. The Commander and his army of death vamps can't get her on their side, so they must eliminate her from joining forces with their adversary. This adds nonstop action to the book. Alison is thrust from human therapist to vampire warrior so fast she should have gotten whiplash.Oh my, when Kerrick and Alison FINALLY get nekkid... HOT! The sexual tension had been radiating off of these two prior to them ever meeting. The attraction they have for each other goes so deep. It is all because of the breh-hedden (mate-bond) that ascendants are capable of obtaining. The bond process is very sexy. The possibility of them completing this bond made all of the romantic actions between Kerrick and Alison extremely sexy.The secondary characters were fascinating. Kerrick fellow warriors are all yummy. Roane givers her readers just enough info about each warrior that you are left salivating and wanting more. Endelle, the Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth has some interesting people skills that make you love to hate her. The constant pondering by her warriors as to what she is wearing is funny and let you know that her warriors have solid respect for her even if they wish she would deliver her orders in a different manor.***there is HEAVY profanity and GD is OVERLY used***",1,amazon

40,"The novel runs in some parts like a sappy love story, and in others like a perfect propaganda piece. Karen Kingsbury clearly has opinions on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, which she is entitled, but when she mixes such a heavy subject with an already saturated love story the result is less than desirable.In regards to the war, she fails to mention nuclear weapons that never materialized and other important facts as to why the US is at war. Kingsbury only brushes the surface on major points in the war, and completely evades others. All the characters are devoutly Christian, something rare in our society. The dialogue is downright childish, and all the characters are one dimensional, with either good hearts, or bad hearts. There is no mental dialogue, just sentiment. Justin as a character is too perfect, and in that sense, completely flawed.This novel is very poorly written. The author mentions that it took five days to write, and I think that explains a lot. She must be used to pumping books out every so often and ""making deadlines"". This creates very poor literature, evidently. I think only her most loyal fans with like this one.",0,amazon

Every new plot twist opens more and more complexities for the characters to face and it is all wrapped up in a great way.This book is HIGHLY recommended, but when you get it you should probably buy another Nance book with it because you'll finish this one probably as fast as you finished Da Vinci Code and you'll want to immediately start another Nance thriller.",1,amazon

Then - unaccountably - the rest of the book is a confusing mess with the author making every possible error a &quot;thriller&quot; writer can make. It is difficult to believe that the brilliant scholarship that is so evidently displayed in the beginning can denigrate into such an ineffective, rambling narrative. Either the author fell in love with himself and thought he could get away with anything - or - he is &quot;on&quot; something. Don't waste your time with this one.

Taken together they sum up much of Jung's analytical psychology, covering the subjects:dream analysis,problems of psychotherapy,aims of psychotherapy,theory of types,stages of life,contrasts between Freud and Jung,archaic man,psychology and literature,basic postulates (i.e. philosophic notions) of analytical psychology,spiritual problem of modern man, and,psychotherapists or the clergy.Jung's professional writings can be a hard read being long and difficult to follow.  There is none of that problem in this work.  Here Jung is clear as a bell.  The book is highly recommended for those beginning their inquiry into Jung.Although &lt;Modern Man> was first published in 1933 it still holds relevance to a contemporary audience.  One major theme running through several speeches is that many people seem to inherently want to believe in something spiritual, though this certainly does not necessarily imply mainstream religion such as Christianity.  We only have to visit a new age bookshop packed with Buddhist and other Asian philosophic texts, not to mention esoteric volumes on spirits, magic and psychic phenomena, to realize that many people are 'looking for something in their lives.'  Of course not all of us have spirituality as an issue or problem and Jung at one point goes to some trouble to point this out.  Some are hung up on sex, other on power, etc.  In these cases a psychology other than Jung's analytical psychology is recommended.",1,amazon

56,"This was a tough book for me to get through for a couple of reasons.  The author spent way much time on the childhood of Liberty, and as some other reviewers mentioned, the way Liberty acted as a teen seemed unrealistic.  The first person view also made the book difficult to get through.  I also thought the title didn't fit the story, and I think I expected the story to go a different route because of the title.  The author spent way too much time on the teen years and not enough time developing the ending.  Like someone else said, it seemed like the author ran out of gas and just wanted to be done.The one redeeming quality of the book is the message that what we think we want from the past is not always what is best for us.  I also think the whole point of the book was to show us that Liberty's view of Hardy wasn't actually who he was.  I didn't take it that Hardy changed.  I think there were signs  of his character as a teen that showed he was probably not a good fit for Liberty.  She just didn't see that at the time.",0,amazon

58,"The Tea Party Movement sends a loud and very clear message to Washington bureaucrats that the American people are totally fed up with both democratic and republican career politicians and their unsustainable spending that has bankrupted this country and also their unconstitutional intrusion into every area of citizen's private lives. The American people are not dumb children who can't make our own choices and take our lumps for any unwise ones. It is just this freedom of choice made possible by limited government that made this country the one people from all over the world so desperately want to immigrate to. Texas Governor Rick Perry in ""Fed Up"" not only summarizes the problems which beset American government with bull's eye accuracy, but also gives the most workable solutions of almost any book I have read on this subject. I would very much like to see everyone of his commonsense solutions put into law. We desperately need to get back to interpreting the plainly stated provisions in the Constitution for what they say and not what will serve certain vested interests most profitably at any given moment.What are some of Perry's proposals for change? First and most importantly repeal of Obama Care. This huge bill which even its supporters admitted they never read is totally unconstitutional and will put this country many trillions of dollars further in debt when we are already bankrupt many times over. It is designed by liberals with the specific purpose of completing America's transition into a socialist nation and to destroying us. The liberals of both parties who don't like the American system can always move to some country more in line with their social ideals. According to Perry we also need to restrict federal spending, institute tax reform, pass a bill eliminating earmarks, undertake a restructuring of our court system,  give back block grants to states for education, transportation and other areas in which the federal government has no business meddling or even better stop the channeling of these funds through Washington altogether, elect leaders who respect the Constitution and hold them accountable and more. Because of its excellent solutions, this book will be current for many years to come. I highly recommend that anyone who values the freedom we still have left as American citizens and wants to insure the survival our our American way of life read this book.",1,amazon
59,"If you've lived in the world of corporate America (and probably corporate anywhere else), you know how it goes...  A seemingly endless parade ofinitiatives and programs designed to revolutionize the company, each one being replaced by the new fad of the month.  As a result, the staff becomesnumb to it all and nothing changes.  But what if there was a way to focus on just a few ""must-win battles"" that rally the company?  That's thedirection of the book Must-Win Battles: How To Win Them, Again And Again by Peter Killing, Thomas Malnight, and Tracey Keys.Content:Section 1 - Preparing the Journey: Understanding Your Starting Conditions; What Does It Take to Lead an MWB Journey?Section 2 - Engaging the Team: Opening Windows - Sharing Perspectives and Realities; Defining the Battles - Colliding to Decide; Committing to OneAgenda - Breaking the SilosSection 3 - Making it Happen: Engaging the Organization; From Tent to Tent - The Unilever Ice Cream Journey; Lessons from MWB Journeys Won and LostAppendixes - The MWB Journey Roadmap; The Denison Survey - Questions; Using External Assistance; IndexThe authors take you through the process of forming and executing ""Must-Win Battles"" (MWB), corporate goals that take priority over all others.  These MWBs are targets that, if achieved, would make a significant impact on your market share, profitability, or perhaps even your survival.  Following a well-documented process, they explain now to work through the entire process, pitfalls and all.  There's also an on-going fictional story of a company and CEO who embarks on this journey.  Using the story, the straight ""facts"" surrounding the process start to take on flesh and blood, and you can see how issues arise and how they might be resolved.  It's not an easy path by any means, but the payoff at the end can be substantial.Reading through the book (and working in Information Technology), I was reminded of a very large software company.  They are even referenced inplaces within the book for key MWBs that propelled their company to the front of the market and has kept them there for many, many years.  Conversely, it appears of late that they want to have a finger in absolutely everything, from consumer electronics and gaming to every aspectof the computer desktop (and then some).  The loss of a single overriding battle to be won has led to a thousand little battles that don't coordinatewell with each other.  Although they can continue to throw money at the problems, you wonder if perhaps it's time for them to read this book andtake it to heart.A solid plan for businesses looking to break the ""business fad du jour"" cycle.

Those simply pursuing a basic path of understanding TA will find it is a road tht ultimately leads to frustration, whereas those looking to trade the traders will be met with an endless world of opportunity.

If you don't know on which side you fall, odds are you are someone's next meal.

However, before they can reside comfortably the house needs a cleaning as the former SPOOR president was a rat pack.  Meg and Michael decide to host a yard sale.  Neighbors and family are encouraged to make the sale into a mega-gala by selling junk and providing special discounts for those in costume.  The only rule is that the barn is off-limits.Chaos reigns as is typical when Meg's family shows up for an event.  However, bedlam takes a deadly turn when slimy antique dealer Gordon McCoy enters the forbidden zone barn; someone obvious followed as the culprit uses a bookend to kill the intrusive intruder.  Police Chief Henry Burke has plenty of suspects as a lot of people apparently entered the barn, but hones in on a professor at Michael's school.  Meg thinks the cop is way off base so she begins her own loony investigation.This satirical amateur sleuth stars a wonderful heroine and a flock of zany relatives, friends, acquaintances, and other loons and birdbrains.

The author is clearly ignorant of those times that shaped the history of the Delta, the floods of 1927 and '37 followed by the migrations of black people to the North followed by the mechanical cotton picker, followed by the emmigration of light industry to the &quot;new&quot; south. This superficial book is typical of the ideological rectitude among apologists that permeate parochial history departments.

82,"When her father is blinded in an accident and no longer able to support his family, 16-year-old Griet is hired as a maid by the painter Vermeer and his jealous, egocentric, and frequently pregnant wife. Griet's responsibilities in the house are legion, and her tasks rendered more difficult by the unkindness of several of her new home's inhabitants. When Vermeer adopts her as an assistant in his studio--and subsequently determines to paint her--interpersonal relations below stairs are only worsened.Tracy Chevalier has written a believable and moving account--or imagining--of the creation of Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" the painting which graces the cover of the paperback. The genius of the book lies in Chevalier's investing the act of painting Griet with a dark significance one would not imagine it to possess. There is in Griet's modeling for Vermeer the potential for tragedy, and in the painter's final brushstrokes a form of abuse. Communicating this significance to readers--and imagining this history of the painting in the first place--is quite an accomplishment.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece",1,amazon

87,"Is it true that we can mind our own business all the time? Is it true that as long as we don't do things that hurt people, we are fine? Is it also true that what we do is nobody's business? No! We are more connected than we think. We are more bounded together than we can ever imagine. The sooner we realize this, the better. In this book, Chris Brauns has masterfully expressed this through the principle of the rope. That is the key to understanding this book. With the rope, we are bounded together as one. Without the rope, our relationships easily unravel. With the rope, we live in solidarity through thick and thin, in both good times as well as bad. Without the rope, we come together in happy times, but disperse during unhappy moments. The trouble with human nature is that people tend to come together in good times, but when the bad times come, they flee. They go away. They leave one another alone, disconnected, isolated, and lonely.Beginning with an observation of an individualistic modern culture, Brauns shows us how the movie characters like the ""Lone Ranger,"" ""Shane,"" ""Pale Rider,"" and more recently, ""Jack Reacher"" glorify the individual hero. The trouble is, it entices us to be lone rangers or individual rambos in our various contexts. Brauns notes that our modern culture ""idolizes the free-floating, unhindered, and isolated hero cut off from any formal responsibilities."" Such people eventually live for themselves, care for their own world, and die a lonely death. In contrast, ""biblical individualism"" has a healthy sense of self-identity within a participative spirit of living in community.We are bounded together far more intimately than we even know. One act can lead to multiple consequences. Just like one accident on a freeway can lead to heavy congestion, missed appointments, and frustrations all around, we are to be constantly reminded of two things. First, no man is an island. Second, everyone lives in places where there are multiple points of connection and consequences. We badly need an antidote to counter the rising disease of individualism and selfishness. Such individualistic tendencies are only pathetic attempts to hide what is essential for us as human people. We are made to connect with one another. We are meant to be in touch with people, and to be considerate toward one another. If there is one message to take home from this book, it is this: We are connected to one another, whether we admit it or not, whether we like it or not, whether we realize it or not.Brauns has given us a valuable book to show us that we are bounded together as human beings, and that we need one another. We need each other to work together and live together. We need one another in order to build a community for all. The musketeers's famous words still ring through: ""One for all, and all for one!"" Just like one bad act like Adam/Eve can lead to the downfall of mankind, one great sacrifice of love, through Jesus Christ gives the whole world life and eternal salvation. Even though some of us can be critical about the idea of original sin, we must similarly grapple with the truth of the gospel. We cannot criticize God just on the basis of sin. We need to acknowledge the God of love, who despite his greatness, chooses willingly to humble himself, to take up the Cross, to be humiliated, executed, and finally raised from the death. Why must God go through all the trouble? It is simply this. Love binds us together. God is not one who is distant far away. He is now near, and he is always here.Some people may choose to deny the principle of the rope, and carry on a mind their own business model. The truth is, sooner or later, they will come to the crossroads of human connection and communities of people. The sooner we accept the reality of relationships, we better we can become more human. We are indeed made for each other. We are bounded together.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me free by Zondervan and NetGalley without any obligation for a positive review.

As many reviewers have pointed out, his tone can be ham-handed and adversarial, some of what he says is little more than rehashed Unitarianism, he often tries to structure a logical argument within seemingly dichotomous existensial parameters, and he is oddly speechless on the subject of the Hereafter.I give this book the full 5 stars for Spong's courage alone. His willingness to put himself out there and endure the demonization of countless legions of fundamentalist Christians is something I've had the notion but never the will to do. Bishop Spong's dedication in the midst of this oh-so-self-righteous opposition is a testament to his real and continually evolving faith.&quot;JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED.&quot; I've always held firmly to the belief that Matthew 7:1 was at some point in time stricken from the collective memories of most fundamentalist Christians. Many of them base their entire lives on judging and condemning others, never stopping to embrace the one God that we could all conceivably agree on: the God of love, the God of mercy, the God of acceptance. And that's what makes Bishop Spong so refreshing: he gets this, he embraces this God, and he's a man at peace with himself because of it.",1,amazon

96,"Prior to September 11, a large number of brillliant people argued that there was no such thing as a superior or inferior culture. All cultures were, despite all evidence to the contrary, equal. Some people ate with forks; others with chopsticks. Some cultures had elections, provided universal public education, and used hi-tech computers. Others persecuted women, celebrated brutal dictators, and praised murder in the name of some religion. All were equal. There was no difference between the backward, primative Afghanistan and modern, democratic United States.How did this nonsensical, ultra-romantic idea become so widespread - almost unquestioned - &quot;truth&quot; in academic circles? The End of Racism helps answer this puzzling question. First, anthropoligists expand the word &quot;culture&quot; to include all and any behavior. Cannabalism is one culture; shopping at the malls is another cultural activity. In the aftermath of WWII and the Nazi's glorification of Aryans as a superior people, the newly created UNESCO declares that all civilizations/cultures are equal. This diplomatic ideal becomes the foundation for multicultural education across the United States a few decades later.This thick tome deserves to be read - or at least skimmed - by everyone interested in the terrible legacy of racism. Educators, administrators, and social activists will find D'Souza's discussion of Booker T. Washington and W.B.DuBois to be illuminating. Washington emphasized the need for individuals to become educated, skilled, and moral while W.B.DuBois emphasized the need to change laws, customs, and social structures. While they could have ideally complemented each other, these two men became fierce antagonists. D'Souza tracks the statements - and consequences -of each man's philosophy. Needless to say, W.B.DuBois the Pan Africanist Marxist - despite his brilliant achievements as a writer and activist - provided far more false answers than real responses to the acute suffering of his people.There are dozens of fascinating snapshots of intellectual debates, over several centuries, in this comprehensive work. The endnotes are an education in themselves.After celebrating differences between civilizations for three decades in academia, perhaps people are ready to hear some hard, cold, and uncomfortable truths.We can only hope that the distinction between moral and immoral, rational and irrational, just and unjust, modern and primative, will again be considered relevant.",1,amazon
97,"Lineup by the Israeli author Liad Shoham is a great mystery and thriller.  It had me on the edge of my seat and it held my attention throughout.  I didn't want to put it down.The premise of this book is that a grunt named Ziv Nevo is falsely accused of raping a woman.  He is found on the street where the rape took place but he is there for other suspicious reasons, ones that involve criminal activities that he doesn't want to talk about.  Nachum, the detective who arrests and accuses Nevo, gets in big trouble because the arrest is not done by the book.  He gets put on suspension but he continues to investigate the case.  He will not stop until he finds the rapist and puts him away.This is not only a police procedural but a look at the culture of Israel.  It is also a thriller as it involves the criminal activities of the underworld.  It has many twists and turns and the plot is complex and worthy of a very good mystery.I applaud the translator, Sara Kitai, for making the book a smooth and enjoyable read.  I hope that more of Shoham's books get translated into English.  I, for one, would read them all.",1,amazon
98,"Patrick Buchanan is getting ever bolder now that his public career is coming to an end. First he offended by writing his magnum opus, ""Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War"" arguing the old Charles Lindberg thesis that we should have stayed out. Now he writes that America is being destroyed as a white nation through uncontrolled Third World immigration and affirmative action to eliminate whites (and white males particularly) from the job market.No one can read his book and doubt that he is right. The documentation is self-evident. The question is: When will whites finally wake up and react?",1,amazon
99,"Tiger Lily is so not your Disney Peter Pan story.  It's a rather dark, sorrowful reimagining.  The story isn't the most exciting but fans of the original will enjoy it and everyone will adore Jodi Lynn Anderson's magical writing.Tiger Lily is a very unusual heroine.  She's aloof, sometimes cold, and not always very likable. She's oblivious to some of the things going on around her, especially when it comes to things involving boys.  Readers will have a hard time connecting to her at first but by the end it's impossible not to love her.  My heart broke for her by the end.Now Tiger Lily is the main character but the story is not told from her point-of-view.  Instead it's told from Tinker Bell's point-of-view.  Tinker Bell is an extremely loyal little fairy who is with Tiger Lily from the beginning.  There are gaps in the story when Tinker Bell wasn't present but she is a reliable narrator even with those gaps.  She was actually my favorite character in the book.  She was smart, cunning, kind, and loyal.  She loved Tiger Lily very much and she wanted to see her happy. Her past could have been better developed but that wasn't a huge flaw for me.The story is not fast-paced.  A lot of readers will lose interest because it doesn't really seem to go anywhere for quite some time.  There is very little action in the book and even that part manages to be slow.  The story is just a little too dull to get through quickly but it is worth it when you get to the end.Now the story may not be super gripping but the writing is.  The writing completely blew me away.  I have never read anything by Jodi Lynn Anderson so I didn't really know what to expect.  Even if I'd gone in with the highest expectations, her writing would have exceeded them.  This book is worth a read for the writing alone.Overall, Tiger Lily definitely could have been better but I was very pleased with it as it was.  Fans of the original Peter Pan story will greatly enjoy it.",1,amazon
