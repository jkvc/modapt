0,amazon,"After reading so many of the reviews and this book I am unsure why readers debated about which of America's suitors they liked best. We have the ex-boyfriend, Aspen, (who is older) that entices and continues a secret two-year relationship with her beginning at age 15 that puts her in danger of severe punishment for breaking curfew laws and involves obvious abuse of trust in book 1. He follows this up in book 2 by regretting that he demanded she sign up for the prince's wife Selection and breaking her heart (because he misses the affection), then he manipulates her into a second secret relationship which is punishable by DEATH. So he's a real catch.Second we have the prince who is dating 35 women in a Batchelor-style reality show who romances the 17 year old making her think she is his one-and-only and giving her the thinking time she asks for without telling her what he's thinking or doing while he romances the other women and &#34;patiently&#34; waits. And everything he does with the other women without seeing her for weeks at a time should not affect her or his relationship with her. So he's a real prince of a guy.We are told (ad nauseum) that Aspen is her &#34;constant&#34; and Maxun makes her feel adored... I wouldn't call manipilation by two older men a &#34;love triangle,&#34; but maybe I'm fuzzy on the definition.This book is a fast and furious storm of musical chairs. It doesn't occur to America that switching from one guy to the other might be contributing to her confusion. It doesn't occur to the guys to be honest with her or themselves about what they are doing to her. And there's always the penalty-of-death thing, which becomes very real but doesn't sway anyone's decisions. And none of this even touches the manipulation by fellow competitors in the Selection or palace intrigue heavily sprinkled with fashion dress designs. And there's the nationally mandatory state-of-the-union-address talk-show, which has always been transformed into weekly entertainment by eating popcorn. (During the Selection, plausible, but always? Yay, we're losing the wars!)At the end, which is actually a pause between chapters, I felt whiplashed and resentful of the emotional manipulation with no payoff. It felt like a whole lot of filler craziness with a big dollop of &#34;it's all her fault.&#34; The entire book will probably be summarized in a couple of pages in book 3. My recommendation: Save time, aggrivation, and money; skip The Elite."
1,amazon,If you've ever read this series by Mercer Mayer you know the idea.  It's a short book with nice illustrations that your kids will love.  And for the price of these you can't go wrong!
2,amazon,"As other reviews have pointed out here, this is quite different from most of Larry Niven's works.  I have read many of his novels, some are more interesting than others.  Occasionally I found he would get into obsessive detail describing something that I couldn't really visualize, and I would skip ahead.  (As much as I love the Ringworld series, parts of that book fall into this category.)This book was much easier to read than many of Niven's works because it was mostly plot driven.  And what a plot it was.  It features the  adventures of Jeremy Bloocher who lives on the partly terraformed planet Destiny.  Through his eyes, we see several different societies on this planet, and how men and women interrelate, and the differing types of economy.  There were many gripping moments of adventure that made it hard to put the book down.  But the ending of the book was fairly anti-climatic.  Niven leads up to a big revelation, but it's not a huge surprise.I would recommend this book to people who are looking for a fun science fiction book that talks about economics and sociology.  There is even an interesting alien race, the Otterfolk, and Niven doesn't mention that their females aren't sentient like he does with many other alien races he has created!"
3,amazon,"I'm very new to Ruby, but I find learning new programming languages fun and challenging. I like to dig in as quickly as possible, using what examples I can find to show me how the language works, and reading the documentation when I have to. After getting a feel for the language, I start reading the books. I don't start with books, usually, because they're often not geared for a programmer learning a second language.But I found Programming Ruby to be an excellent starting point -- it provides the quick-start help I need by giving numerous and well thought-out examples both in the body of the text and in the reference section (see below).The chapters are well arranged (and even include information on distributed Ruby on page 272, often where most texts just start talking about file I/O!), with the first 276 pages devoted to an introduction to the language. The last 250-or-so pages contain an excellent library reference, alphabetically arranged.The devil is in the details, though. And here, AW put a lot of thought into the finer points. The type is clear; the typographic conventions are standard and, if you've used any other typical programmer's text, easy to follow. So far, this is what you'd expect from any good computer title. In addition, however, they have added an easy-to-use thumbtab system for the alphabetical arrangement of the reference section, so finding a particular entry is quick and easy. Each entry in the reference section is clearly laid out with a class hierarchy (including super- and subclasses), parameters, description, &quot;Mixes in&quot; and a list of all class methods (most (if not all) with examples and output. All well-designed not only for the experienced Ruby programmer but also for the novice.The index is thorough, with helpful vertical lines between the columns, and the reference section entry is identified by bold page numbers.All in all, I would highly recommend this book for new Ruby programmers.  There are still a number of things I don't understand about Ruby, but this book is an excellent place to start. It sets the bar very high for future books on this new and exciting programming language."
4,amazon,"This is the third and final book in the Night Angel trilogy.  It wraps up the series nicely and the multitude of plots are mostly wrapped up neatly.  It ended happier than I thought it would given what all of our characters are put through.  I listened to this on audio book and it was very well done (please forgive any name/place mis-spellings).The God King has been defeated but now there are other dangers to Cenaria's kingdom.  Kylar wants Logan to accept the Kingship of Cenaria, but Logan wants to uphold his vow to the current Queen.  Vi is off to the Chantry to begin her mage training with the Sisters.  Elene is on her way to the Chantry to visit Vi and Uly.  Basically all of the various kingdoms are perched to attack each other and all of our favorite characters have positions of power throughout the various kingdoms.  If I tried to list where everyone was and what they were doing here...this review would turn into a novella.As in previous novels Weeks does an excellent job keeping the reader engaged with the characters.  The characters are life-like and really pull you into the story; they make mistakes, they try their best, sometimes they do good, sometimes they (especially Kylar) make a mess of it all.The plot was twisted and convoluted and came from a billion different perspectives.  It was kind of fun to watch the characters making decisions about their kingdoms without knowing what was happening in other kingdoms.  All the secrets come out in the end, but throughout the story so many major decisions are made without characters knowing what is really going on in other parts of the kingdom that it is very ironic.  At times this can be a bit annoying because it seems like the characters go off on tangents they don't really need to go down to make the story progress.  As with the other books the story is engaging but progresses slowly because of all the different perspectives.The threesome of Solon, Dorian, and Feir gets a lot more page space in this book.  It was good to read about them more.  We didn't get to read about Uly much at all; she was talked about in the background but not really present in the story.  I missed her.Weeks has a great writing style to read; very readable with some humor throughout.  As with previous books, this is a book for adults.  There is a lot of talking about sex, swearing, and many gruesome scenes.My only big problem with the plot is that the evil that the characters are fighting against is less apparent than it was when they were fighting the God King in the last book.  The evil in this book is more sprawling and less concentrated.  In fact most of the characters are just trying to hold their kingdoms together and don't even realize that they are dealing with the Goddess Kali until the end of the book.  It just makes the end battle a bit less profound.The book wrapped everything up nicely; although there are some things that point at future stories being set in this world.Overall this was an excellent conclusion to this series.  Weeks weaves a complicated and intriguing story with realistic characters that are very engaging.  My only complaints are that the multitude of perspectives the story is told from slows down the progress of the story, the battle the characters were fighting was less about destroying a great evil and more about protecting their individual kingdoms.  I did enjoy the way everything was wrapped up.  I enjoyed this series enough that I will probably pick up The Black Prism by Brent Weeks at some point.  I recommend also readingMistborn Trilogyby Brandon Sanderson orThe Codex Alera seriesby Jim Butcher if you enjoyed this series."
5,amazon,You will take many things away from Bryson's book it is the most complete coverage of the history of science I have ever seen.  However as a scientist the most important lesson for me is that every advance comes down to the persistent efforts of one or two people.The book was given to me and I am already planning on giving it to others.
6,amazon,Are you kidding me.... this is an example of getting two books from the original one. . What a ripoff. I was totally disappointed
7,amazon,"""The Salon.com Reader's Guide to Contemporary Authors"" is edited by Laura Miller, with Adam Begley. It consists primarily of alphabetically-arranged entries on selected writers. Each entry contains a list of books by the author, as well as a critical essay. This collection of writers is international and multicultural, although the selection is (as noted in the preface) limited to authors who write (or wrote) fiction in English and who have had major works published since 1960.This is a book that I use both to ""discover"" authors I'm not familiar with, as well as to get new perspectives on authors I already know (either passingly or thoroughly). Each entry is about 1 to 2 pages long. A very short sampler of some of the authors covered: Chinua Achebe, Sherman Alexie, Saul Bellow, Charles Bukowski, Ian Fleming, Allegra Goodman, Ursula K. LeGuin, Amy Tan, Gore Vidal, etc.The critical articles contain some questionable statements, but that's half the fun of this book: it's a reference work with which an intelligent reader can disagree.In addition to the main entries, there is a series of sidebar book lists compiled by various individuals. Examples: ""Five Contemporary Noir Classics,"" listed by David Bowman; ""A Walk on the Wild Side: Very Original Novels,"" by Peter Carey; ""Smart and Sexy,"" by Erica Jong; etc. The books are listed with short descriptive paragraphs.There is also a series of interspersed literary essays: ""Every Novel Is a Lesbian Novel,"" by Dorothy Allison; ""Of This World: Why Science Fiction Can't Be Dismissed,"" by John Clute; etc. If you love contemporary literature, you may find ""The Salon.com Reader's Guide"" to be a wonderful resource."
8,amazon,"The Drowned Cities is listed on some sites as the second in the Ship Breaker series. It's a novel set in the same post climate change world as Ship Breaker rather than a ""Book 2"".So don't feel you have to have read Ship Breaker to get the full experience.  The Drowned Cities shares some locations and one character with Ship Breaker - the half-man Tool.Quality fiction-------------------The Drowned Cities is published in Australia by Atom, Hachette's Young Adult brand.  To adult readers I would like to stress that this really has no impact on your enjoyment as an experienced or mature reader - it's just quality fiction.A future dystopia or comment on current events---------------------------------------------------------With The Drowned Cities Bagicalupi builds upon and expands his vision of a dystopian future.  Like Ship Breaker the theme and content mirrors or comments indirectly( I never feel as though Bagicalupi is preaching) upon present day issues.  Ship breaker concentrated on a characters whose living was made stripping great containerships - a modern day inspiration, was no doubt something similar to The Chittagong Ship Breaking yards in Bangladesh.The Drowned Cities' theme centres squarely on the horrors of low scale internecine warfare in failed states and the sad reality of child soldiers and child victims of war.  Bagicgalupi brings the tale closer to home with his setting - The Drowned Cities being the flooded remnants of the eastern states of North and South Carolina.The Tale-------------------Mahlia and Mouse are War Maggots, orphans or refugees taken in by Dr Mahfouz who administers medical treatment to the families of Banyan Town.  Mahlia is a mixed raced daughter of a Chinese Peacekeeper and American/Drowned Cities mother, she's had her right hand cut off by the Army of God due to this fact.Mouse is a country boy with a talent for dodging bullets.  While their situation isn't ideal i.e. the town's folk distrust her, it's relatively safe.  Until that is, Tool,an escaping half-man, a genetic augmentation, draws militia pursuers to their quaint little piece of post apocalyptic hell.What ensues is part comment on the stupidity and futility of war but also on the strength of  friendships borne out of survival.Good Characterisation-------------------Mahlia is the star of the story and I find her depiction as a strong female character particularly realistic and refreshing.  She's a child of war, a survivor and her strength shines through, in her dedication to her friends and her will to go on.She displays cunning in her battles against forces that are physically stronger than her and is a refreshing hero in that she doesn't need a gun or kick-butt martial arts moves to be strong.We also get a better understanding of Tool as a rare breed of half-man, one that has overcome his genetic tendencies and training to obey his masters.I also saw the depictions of the various militias in the book as comments on the some of the extremes of current American politics or political ideologies both in terms of religion and patriotism/nationalism.  No doubt some American readers might find Bagicgalupi's future imaginings a little pointed.Concerns?-------------------The book deals with some fairly mature content.  I never felt as though Bagicgalupi was playing to the more violent aspects of the book though. There's death and dismemberment but is well handled, repectfully depicted and fits well within the context of the world that's been created.I can see Ship Breaker and The Drowned Cities as good jumping off points for discussions in a class mixing literature/reading with social studies.The depiction of sex within the book, such that it is, is handled ""off screen"".Judgement-------------------A good addition to Bagicgalupi's vision of a world in decline or crawling out of one.  There's violence, poverty and calamity, but there's also hope. There's always a sense that the protagonists can prevail - not without consequences mind you, but that it is possible.This book was provided to me by the publisher at no cost to myself"
9,amazon,"Delightful novel of the civil war era showing the involvement of naval and ground forces  of one family,the Raveneaus'  Of course, it has started a series, promising good reading.  Dottiek"
10,amazon,"I am a fan of reading, therefore, I am going to rate the book not the author. This was a good book. The premise was scary and it made me look twice at my dog (whom I love).  It was different, short, and the details were well written. Yes it's a little sci-fi horror but it made me want to hear the ending (audiobook)if you are looking for a quick read this is it.  I have read many Patterson books I would not say he is a formulated writer therefore each book has its own merits."
11,amazon,"The slave ship gives a fascinating forte in the archives of slavery and the making of modern history. It was a vehicle, transporting captives whose labor was necessary for America's economic survival; it was a factory, where African men, women, and children were transformed into ""cargo""; and it was an instrument of war, complete with fearsome weapons with the capability to destroy any who might challenge its gruesome mission. In Marcus Rediker's book it explores these historical uses of the slave ship by drawing on an astonishing array of archival material, revealing the voices of slaves, common sailors, pirates, captains, and traders in all their complex humanity. Rediker's talent as a writer and a historian is to bring this kind of disparate information into one solid, available and enthralling narrative."
12,amazon,"Never before has compassion in religion been so sorely needed, we are reminded by this one time Roman Catholic nun, best selling religious historian and passionate campaigner for religious liberty. It would be difficult to disagree with this statement. But this is a book not just for the faithful religious. As she quotes the Dalai Lama as saying in his Ethics for the New Millennium (New York, 1999), p. 19: ""whether a person is a religious believer does not matter much. Far more important is that they be a good human being.""And this book sets out to help us all be just that.The book starts with a promotion of the Charter for Compassion, the brainchild of Armstrong, created and launched by her in 2009 with the help of TED (Technology Entertainment and Design known for its ""Ideas Worth Spreading"" conferences - and if you are not familiar with TED you should rectify that straightaway!). The Charter's aim is to bring compassion back to the heart of moral and religious life, and in involving the major faiths in its creation the Charter demonstrates that despite their differences the religions can work together for justice and peace. The Charter thus counters the voices of extremism, intolerance and hatred.We are all invited to sign up to this Charter, to pledge our selves to a compassionate way of life, (although again this does not insist on us being religious, just compassionate) and this book is here to help us achieve this, to help us to translate the Charter into practical and realistic action across the globe.The book is a self-help book that is very far from the self-interest genre that justifiably comes in for some criticism. This is a book to help save the world by healing our own behaviour, an idea very close to my own heart, as expressed in my own book, Healing This Wounded Earth: with Compassion, Spirit and the Power of Hope. As Armstrong points out, and as I have done before her, responsibility for this broken world has to start with the individual. We cannot expect our leaders to adopt humane and compassionate policies unless we change ourselves.As given away in the title, this book is written along the lines of the Alcoholics Anonymous 12 point plan, and if we follow the steps carefully and diligently we will surely be able to modify our behaviour and the world will become a better more compassionate place. And we will certainly be happier. Armstrong has no illusions that this will be easy - it will be a lifelong process for us, as we will have to struggle all the way against self hatred and discouragement. But the steps are well explained, and supported with plenty of background information and encouragement at each stage. I was not absolutely sure about her explanations in the Preface of the evolution of the human brain - they may be viewed by the scientifically inclined as perhaps being a little too simplistic, but I do not think this matters to the overall theme. Suffice to say that it seems we may be hard wired for compassion as well as for cruelty and that is encouraging!I heartily recommend the twelve-step process she outlines - to aspire to become truly compassionate persons. It is not, she assures us, beyond our capacity, but our vital work is indeed just beginning when we get to the last page of the book.I actually reviewed the paperback that came out in 2011, published by The Bodley Head"
13,amazon,"This book is so powerful and engrossing that I could not put it down.  When it was recommended to me I thought it would be depressing because of all this little boy goes through, but it is the exact opposite.  It inspired me to greater things and thoughts in my own life.  We all have struggles but this book taught me a beautiful lesson of a new way of looking at adversity.  I loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who loved to read."
14,amazon,"Gives one a very good idea of how traumatic and depressing it was for Peter's family and families like Peter's. How hopeless, despairing and often frightening the situation was and still is. How the world stands by does nothing. A very human story, a story of destiny, the struggles and courage of those brave souls in the face of utter despair and hopelessness. Well portrayed and an easy read. Highly recommend.Reviewed by author of:CHECKMATEandVeiled Madnessand soon to be: [...]"
15,amazon,"The premise of this alternate history is the debate between two competent Japanese naval officials over how many waves of attack would be needed to render the Americans as helpless.  Admiral Yamamoto felt you had to keep the pressure up to and including the forty-eight contiguous states while Admiral Nagumo felt Pearl Harbor left the United States helpless and defeated.  In this novel, Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen explore the Yamamoto theory starting with the Japan of the 1930s until the December attack on much more than just Pearl Harbor.The look at Japanese society and its military invasion of China in the 1930s is fabulous and insightful.  The argument between the two admirals over what is needed to beat America is terrific as Yamamoto believes they United States can come back if it is a one or even two punch assault.  However, the political leaders, FDR and Hirohito seem one dimensional and that dimension is wordy, pompous and out of touch.  Still this strong what if alternate military history account of the War in the Pacific is discerning yet entertaining.Harriet Klausner"
16,amazon,"My 4th grade son (a reluctant reader) was motivated to read this book, even though it was difficult for him at first.  He now loves reading all sorts of text and has really improved in his decoding skills.  I think reading this series even inspired him to start writing his own short stories featuring our pets.  Highly recommend this series and am thankful to the author for writing engaging stories for upper elementary kids!"
17,amazon,Really enjoyed this one and am looking to incorporate some of the places Paul Bowles' talkes about on my next vacation.  Looking forward to visiting Madeira off the coast of Portugal.
18,amazon,"This is the first book in a series which readily admits to being inspired by the character of Tinkerbell from Peter Pan.  Tinkerbell&#8217;s sisters are not yet grown up and so they live with all the younger fairies on Sheepskerry Island . Their names are Clara Bell, Lily Bell, Rosie Bell, Silver Bell and baby Squeak; they  go to fairy school, eat fairy food, play fairy games, try to avoid trolls,  and once a year (if they are good and old enough)  they go to the Fairy Ball.  It is the week of the Fairy Ball and Silver is desperate to go, but you have to be eight before you are allowed.  Yet the Fairy Ball is where the fairies &#8220;put on their diamond wings and walk on satin ribbons under the stars.&#8221;  So, which fairy wouldn&#8217;t want to take part?This book has short chapters and is ideal for newly fluent readers, who are ready to tackle something a little longer.  The story really encourages little readers to keep going.  So, for example, a chapter ends, &#8220;if you would like to hear about a brave little fairy, who can also be rather naughty and get in very big trouble with her sisters, just turn the page.&#8221;  When they turn over, the next chapter begins, &#8220;Oh, thank goodness you turned the page!&#8221;  It is a very sweet story and has some lovely illustrations.  Does Silver manage to attend the Fairy Ball?  You will have to read it and find out.  Ideal for 6-8 year olds and will appeal to little girls who love everything pink and pretty (and what&#8217;s wrong with that?)."
19,amazon,"I don't think I've ever picked up a more weird but enticing book.  In the Daughter of Smoke and Bone, we mainly follow Karou and we are slowly being introduced to the world she's in.  She lives in the human world but behind closed doors, she's raised by partly human creatures who are the only family she's ever known.  She's your typical teenager, with the exception of having naturally blue hair and oh...she runs errands for her family by collecting teeth.  Why the teeth?  Well, Karou doesn't know and we as readers don't know either until further along into the book.I like that we know just as little as Karou and each page introduces something new to us.  The world that Laini Taylor has build is awesomely weird in the best way possible.  I loved Karou as a main heroine...she's not your typical whiney main character in your YA genre.  Akiva was also a great mysterious character.  You really don't know much about Akiva until the second half of the book, or why he feels this urging pull towards Karou.  I've never read a book like this and I applaud Ms. Taylor for having such a great imagination."
