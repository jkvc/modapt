1,amazon,1,"have always loved the play Henry V by Shakespeare (and the Kenneth Branagh adaptation) but never understood how it was possible so few English soldiers killed so many French. This historical novel makes it crystal clear. It follows the life of an English archer, and explains well the mechanics or archery and fighting with medieval weapons. It describes the dirt and grime of the Middle Ages and the gore of battle without being stomach-turning disgusting. And it has remarkable clean language and implied sexual content so it is suitable for older teens studying the Middle Ages. The description of the Battle of Agincourt is extensive and detailed. &#34;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, This day shall gentle his condition.&#34;"
2,amazon,1,Lawrence Block can always always be counted on to deliver a great read! I highly recommend anything he has written.
3,amazon,0,Soap opera in a setting of generic swords 'n demons fantasy.  I prefer Mr. Martin's earlier work such as &#34;Sandkings&#34;.
4,amazon,0,"I thought the book might be a thriller, but it's a little twisted and not a good enough story to keep me interested."
5,amazon,0,"I don't read enough books by male authors, though when I do, it's always an interesting thing to read about how they write female characters, especially young female characters. I thought Wiley Cash was accurate in his portrayal of two young girls: one only at the tender age of 7, and a pre-teen of 12. Overall, however, This Dark Road to Mercy failed to capture my full attention-the story line started out flat, and continued that way without much deviation or excitement.Told from three alternating POVS, This Dark Road to Mercy was a wild goose chase, with flashbacks and resentment thrown in for good measure. An estranged father kidnaps his two daughters (one being Easter, POV #1) from their group home, loaded with cash and a reason to run. The person hot on their trail, Pruitt (POV #2), has a vendetta and his own troubled back story to tell. All the while, Brady Weller (POV #3), is taking his role as ad litem of the kidnapped girls to a whole new level, as he helps uncover the link between the disappearance of the girls, and another open crime case.I felt like this book had the best intentions, and some intensely good raw material to work with, so it was unfortunate that it ended up reading like an episode of a mediocre prime time detective show. When the POV alternated, I only knew it did because the name above the chapter told me so, otherwise, all three narrators blended into one collective, dull, voice-I wouldn't have been able to tell them apart if there wasn't dialogue in each section. The saving grace of This Dark Road to Mercy was Wade Chesterfield, the estranged father. His character was the only one to invoke enough emotion in me to continue pressing on. His desperation, and the fact that his motives were the reason for pretty much the story line of the entire book, made him the stand out character in my eyes.Main qualm: Cash's use of baseball terms, facts, and players were completely lost on me-baseball is one of my least favourite sports, and I, unfortunately, tended to glaze over those moments in the book.This Dark Road to Mercy just wasn't for me, though I could definitely see it being the exact read that someone else would enjoy, especially a reader with an affinity for sports and detective novels. There seems to be much more to be found in Wiley's other work, so I will definitely be checking that out!"
6,amazon,1,"Found another good author of historical mystery novels.  Kate Ross does a great job of describing the Victorian Era and a better job of spinning a good mystery,"
7,amazon,1,"""Red Herring"" is a pretty good installment in the Joe Gunther series.  The plot regarding a serial killer who seems impossible to catch works pretty well.  The main characters' actions  are consistent with their behavior in previous books.  The Vermont setting is typically well drawn by Mayor.  Overall, the usual elements that make an Archer Mayor mystery good are present, and I can recommend this book.Several plot elements in ""Red Herring"" were of particular interest to me.  First, Mayor allows the new woman in Joe Gunther's life and his former girlfriend of many years to meet.  Readers of this series have to have been wondering how Gail is going to deal with Joe's new love.  Second, there are also some interesting forensics to help solve the mystery this time.  Third, the ending, including the final scene with Willy,  is very unexpected and very dramatic, which is quite a good move on Mayor's part.I have a couple of criticisms.  I feel the amount of detail related to the forensic aspects of the case is too much at times.  Also, I struggle again with Mayor's point-of-view shifts.  This time he tells the story through his main characters along with brief sections in which the victims are featured.  Then at the end he suddenly starts to include sections from the killer's point of view.  This change just feels so inconsistent, and I notice it immediately. I actually find it pretty annoying when Mayor does this.For more mystery series that may entertain you, check out my website describing and reviewing many series (see my Amazon profile for the URL)."
8,amazon,1,"A small part of the Michael Lewis's best-selling book, ""The Blind Side"" and the popular movie of the same title, starring Sandra Bullock. Finally, Michael Oher has co-authored his own book about HIS remarkable story. Oher's book is definitely not some short piece of fluff. It covers 21 chapters over about 250 pages, and sheds light on the real life Michael Oher lived. While this book is easy to read, it still packs a powerful punch. The most touching chapter...""The Day They Took Me Away,"" describes what happened when Child Protective Services came to take him from his mother. One theme that comes through loud and clear is that Michael Oher was very determined to make something of himself.In short, this book gives huge addition to the other books and gives more depth than the movie about Michael Oher's life. It has a lot of interesting material, and it packs an important, inspiring and profound message. Completely worth the time and the money. More importantly, sheds light on the 500,000 children that are in the foster care system and what their lives and limits the system can handle."
9,amazon,1,MJC yet again delivered on a stella story.  The twists and turns the book took were amazing.  I cannot wait to read another Piper book

12,amazon,1,"PROS: Vast scope of ideas, steeply based in science, epic qualityCONS: Writing style is a bit dryBOTTOM LINE: Great collection of related stories.BRIEF SYNOPSIS: A collection of related stories set in Baxter's Xeelee Universe.The memorable things about Baxter's stories are not so much his characters, nor his writing style, which is a somewhat stiff, but rather his ideas.  Each story contained in this collection contains some form of scientific concept that defies any simple comprehension due to sheer scale, large and small.  Sometimes travel spans universes, sometimes beings are microscopic in size, and sometimes artifacts are light years wide.  Baxter's signature hard science is present here in a big way.The stories average 14 pages in length but are packed with all these ideas.  Many of the stories, spanning 5 million years, reference the same events or reference each other, which is always a secret thrill for a science fiction reader.One huge plus in Vacuum Diagram's is the Xeelee Sequence Timelins listed at the back of the book.  This makes it prerequisite reading for anyone wishing to dive into Baxter's 4 Xeelee novels (in Xeelee Universe order: Timelike Infinity, Raft, Flux and Ring)."
13,amazon,1,"Another Robert Crais winner!. I love Carol Starkey, he did a great job of introducing her and then the book became  her. Mr. Red's purpose in life was to kill those who knew how to take bombs apart prior to explosion. Carol Starkey had almost lost her life when a bomb exploded and killed her partner Sugar. She was on a mission to find the one who detonated that bomb. A great read with many surprises."
14,amazon,1,"In a market flooded with blatant Twilight rip-offs and slightly toned down adult paranormal romance, Beautiful Creatures is surprisingly refreshing. To begin with, Beautiful Creatures features a male protagonist without paranormal abilities and a female lead with abilities. While there is a love story, it is woven into a larger, more engaging plot filled with edge-of-your-seat mystery and intrigue.When I first read the synopsis of the novel, I was expecting yet another teen vampire romance that follows every clich&eacute; in the genre right now. But the marketing information (as well as the novel's title) ended up being misleading -in a good way.Beautiful Creatures centers around teenager Ethan, who lives in the boring (and somewhat backward) Southern town of Gatlin. Ethan begins to have strange visions of the past and finds that the town's newest resident, Lena, shares his visions. As the two become friends and eventually fall in love, Ethan finds that there is more to Lena and her crazy, shut-in Uncle Macon Ravenwood than meets the eye.  Lena comes from a long line of magic-users, called Casters, and on her sixteenth birthday, her fate will be decided forever.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel. Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl weave a compelling mystery that kept me flipping pages. I was even more surprised that this novel looks like it won't have any sequels -it's so powerful and entertaining that readers will probably be clamoring for more (well, I am, anyway). While the pacing occasionally gets a little off (the book is over 600 pages), the need to find out the truth behind the mystery and discover the characters' fate will keep readers going.This is a great book for any one (of any age) who enjoys paranormal/mystery stories geared toward teens with a romance element."
15,amazon,1,I read this book for book club.  Story was alright but I would not recommend it. Very good depiction of characters.

17,amazon,1,"Here's the short version:This hilariously terrifying delve into the mind of a modern Westernised human being read like it was written by a 15yr old anime-porn addicted Stephen King.Here's the long version:To begin with, I didn't know this was the beginning of a series of books. Had I known, then the ending probably wouldn't have been so disappointing for me. The first half of the book was rife with stark potty humour and vividly grotesque visuals, the kind a Robot Chicken or video game fan would find appealing. This is not a negative judgement; I thoroughly enjoy the aforementioned literary cheese. Its a fast flowing yet compelling story filled with easily-imaginable unimaginable horrors, thanks to the writing style of the twisted person who wrote this. Seriously, its some pretty gross stuff.After you are thrust into the main characters disgusting world against your will, you start to find the most obscene scenes funny and delightful, the dialogue expressed in terse blasts that allow the reader to become happily lost in the confusing plot twists and bizarre time jumps. As for the plot itself, I'm not a fan of explaining the contents of a book in its review. That's what the back of the book is for. I will say, however, that my Stephen King reference was not a cheap jab; this story is very much like a cartoon horror story about friends, saving the world, and being a real person.I did find the conclusion to be a let down, only because it was dragged out over more pages than were necessary, completely devoid of any of the sick comedy that carried me through the entire adventure. Having learned its a continuing story, it makes sense. But I cant help feeling like the writer got struck with Lost syndrome; unable to find a cohesive way to justify the ridiculousness he's almost finished, it seems like he opted for the quick finish.All in all, if you can stomach the kind of dark horrors you only dream about on the worst of nights -yet laugh about with your peers the next day- then you will probably enjoy John Dies At The End."
18,amazon,1,"An epic historical novel, similar with its scholar-detective protagonists to The Da Vinci Code, reading like a sequel to Stoker's Dracula. A thrilling, meaty read. Some other reviewers' plot gaps are duly noted, but make this nonetheless worthy of your time. Recommended for fans of classic vampire literature."
19,amazon,1,My husband loves this new author and was very happy to see this book arrive at Christmas time.  Great gift!
